$h$: Planck constant

$\bar{h} = \frac{h}{2\pi}$: reduced Planck's constant.

$E = hf$

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: the better we know a quantum particle's position the less well we know its momentum, and vice versa. Heisenberg's It is due to Waves.

de Broglie equation: wavelength equals Planck's constant divided by momentum.
